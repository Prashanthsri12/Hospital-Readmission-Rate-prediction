# Hospital-Readmission-Rate


The patient readmission probability in US hospital Classification can be made use by hospitals by deploying the model in a large scale and hence the doctors are expected to enter the similar patient details so that they can get those patients classified in to categories where they will be readmitted before 30 days and the patients who will be readmitted after 30 days along with the ones with no readmission at all.

This can help them cut costs in penalty which can further be diverted to funds that can support free medical camps which can help get a patient free diagnosis for his medical complications. It can also result in the hospitals finding the problematic division within the hospital which has proven to get a higher readmission probability and take pro per measures to solve the issue with that division thereby cutting costs even more and making pati ents comfortable with those divisions.

The reduced costs from penalty can support in developing the infrastructure of hospitals and afford advanced equipment â€™s for better healthcare practices.
